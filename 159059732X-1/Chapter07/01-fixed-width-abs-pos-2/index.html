As usual, greedy guts (me) polished off the sweet items that Manda couldn't quite face so early in the day. </p> <p>After a smooth flight, we landed under an ominous-looking sky. It was looking dark and moody in the distance, as if to prove that the five days of thunderstorms forecast for Prague were soon to start. Strangely, though, despite the grey skies in the distance it was hot and sunny as we stepped off the plane to the transfer bus. We might just get lucky with the weather, I thought. </p> <p>Once we got through the usual arrival procedures of claiming baggage, immigration checks etc, we made our way out to where all the transfer buses were waiting for tired travellers. We immediately headed to the right, following a tip from one of Manda's colleagues that there were cheap transfer buses there - a 90 crown fare (approx &pound;2.50) to drop in the centre as opposed to the 490 crown charge for a transfer right to the hotel front door. Luckily, the drop-off point, just around the corner from the Municipal Building, turned out to be an 8-minute walk from our hotel. </p> </div></div><div id="navigation"> <ul>  <li><a href="day1.html">Day 1 (arrival)</a></li>  <li><a href="day2.html">Day 2 (kutna Hora)</a></li>  <li><a href="day3.html">Day 3 (Prague Castle)</a></li>  <li><a href="day4.html">Day 4 (up the towers, Karlstejn Castle)</a></li>  <li><a href="day5.html">Day 5 (Metro tour)</a></li> </ul></div></div></body></html>
